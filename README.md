# Optimized WAN-1.3B: Enhanced Text to Video Generation

This repository contains the source code for a highly optimized version of the Wan2.1-1.3B text to video generation model developed by Wan AI. Several optimization techniques such as LoRA, 4-bit quantization, operator fusion, cpu offloading and CFG parallelism were applied to improve inference speed without compromising on output quality. A gradio interface seamlessly integrates the pipeline, allowing the user to control individual hyperparameters and view metrics to assess resource usage and model performance.
